> A better mushroom island biome.

After thinking about how much potential has been left untapped in the [Ethereal
mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/ethereal/)'s mushroom island biome, this project was born.

Currently a work in progress - documentation will appear here soon once we have got something useful here.
